<h1>Group 2 Electives</h1>
<h2>CMPUT 250
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course Description:</strong><br>An interdisciplinary course for students in Science, Arts, and other faculties. The focus is on games as interactive entertainment, their role in society, and how they are made. Teams composed of students with diverse backgrounds (e.g. English, Art and Design, and Computing Science) follow the entire creative process: from concept, through pitch, to delivery, of a short narrative-based game using a commercial game engine. To achieve the required mix of backgrounds and experience, students must apply to be considered for this course. See the Department web site for the online form.<br></li>
<li><strong>Prerequisite:</strong><br> Second-year standing<br>

</li>
<li><strong>Instructor ratings:</strong><br>Matthew Guzdial's Rate My Professor rating is 4.9/5<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> CMPUT 250 is a challenging course that requires a significant time commitment. Students can expect to spend a lot of time on midterms, finals, labs, and a group project. The tests and labs are relatively easy, but the group project can be more demanding depending on the group dynamics. The course also involves creating music for a game, which can add to the workload. The use of RPG maker for the course reduces the programming requirements, but having programming skills can still be helpful. The average grade for the course is high, indicating that those who put in the effort can expect to earn good grades.</ul>

</li>
<li><strong>Instructor ratings:</strong><br>Marek Reformat's Rate My Professor rating is 4.7/5<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> The course ECE 447 is a new introduction to machine learning, with a great professor and relatively easy assessments. However, the organization of the course is disorganized. The course provides a basic introduction to machine learning and some hands-on experience with data analysis. The programming aspect of the course is not too challenging for those with a software background. Overall, the course is considered fairly easy.</ul>

</li>
<li><strong>Instructor(s):</strong><br>Instructor(s) undecided for Fall Term 2024<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Instructor ratings:</strong><br>No professors teaching this term, so no ratings available at all<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> The comments suggest that ECE 449 is primarily a programming course, and that lab equipment may not be necessary. However, some components might be required for capstone projects. The overall difficulty of the course seems to be moderate, as lab equipment may not be a significant factor.</ul>

<li><strong>Instructor(s):</strong><br>Manisha Gupta (teaching in Winter Term 2024), Instructor(s) undecided for Winter Term 2025<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Instructor ratings:</strong><br>Manisha Gupta's Rate My Professor rating is 1.9/5<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> Based on the provided context, it appears that the commenter is sharing a link to an old syllabus for a Mechanical Engineering course. It is unclear if this course is ECE 450 or not. However, the fact that the commenter mentions an "old syllabus" suggests that the course may have undergone significant changes since then, which could impact the current difficulty level. Without more information, it is impossible to accurately assess the current difficulty of ECE 450 based on this context alone.</ul>

</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> The course ECE 456 in the Faculty of Engineering does not clearly state in the syllabus when a particular assignment is due. The student is unsure if it is due on March 11 in the evening or not. The professor mentioned this date in class, but it was not included in the written syllabus. The course may be considered moderately difficult due to the lack of clear communication regarding assignment deadlines.</ul>
