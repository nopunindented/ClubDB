</li>
<li><strong>Terms the course is available in:</strong><br>Winter Term 2024, Winter Term 2025<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Instructor(s):</strong><br>Ehab Elmallah (teaching in Winter Term 2024), Instructor(s) undecided for Winter Term 2025<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Instructor ratings:</strong><br>The professor does not have a rating on Rate My Professor<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> The course CMPUT 313 is considered to be difficult by some students, with one suggesting that a passing grade (D) might be a better option than failing (W). Another student mentions that the course material can be learned through online resources, implying that the in-class component may not be essential. However, the importance of maintaining a certain GPA for academic programs and the number of W's a student has are also factors to consider. Overall, the course is perceived as challenging and unengaging.</ul>
</div><div class="course"><h2>CMPUT 379
</h2>
<ul>

</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br>379 is considered easier and more fun than 229 by some students, but it is still a challenging course. The material in 379, such as mutexes, semaphores, threads, and processes, is relevant and useful for various types of programming. However, if a student is not interested in this type of programming, they may find the course unnecessary. The assignments take a significant amount of time and regular studying is recommended to succeed in the course. The exams are not overly easy, even with good preparation.</ul>
