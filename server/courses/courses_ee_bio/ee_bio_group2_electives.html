<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> Based on the provided context, it appears that the commenter is sharing a link to an old syllabus for a Mechanical Engineering course at the University of Alberta. While the specific course mentioned is not ECE 450, it is possible to infer some information about the difficulty level of ECE 450 based on the context of the comments.

         The commenter does not explicitly state the difficulty level of ECE 450, but other comments in the thread suggest that it is a challenging course. For instance, one comment reads, "ECE 450 is a beast of a course," while another comment states, "ECE 450 is a tough one, but worth it."

         Based on this context, it can be inferred that ECE 450 is a difficult course. However, it is important to note that the difficulty level of a course can vary from year to year and from professor to professor, so this information should be taken as a general guideline rather than an absolute truth.</ul>

</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> The course BIOCH 200 is considered to be difficult, with students reporting the need to study extensively for exams, particularly focusing on memorizing the amino acids and their charges at certain pHs. The exams are multiple choice but the questions can be tricky, and some students suggest that having access to old exams can be helpful. The course covers the citric acid cycle and students recommend drawing it out on the test as soon as they start writing. The midterm is worth 40% of the final grade, making it a significant portion of the overall grade. The final exam is worth 55% and is reported to be challenging, requiring students to read the questions carefully due to the wording. The course is considered interesting but the workload can be heavy.</ul>
