</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> The comments suggest that Chem 261 is a theory-heavy course that requires a significant amount of studying and practice to understand the concepts and do well on exams. The lab component is also mentioned as being technique-based and requiring memorization for the lab final. Some students found the textbook to be helpful, while others relied on YouTube resources and their professors' notes. The labs are described as time-consuming but worthwhile, and it is recommended to stay on top of the material and not fall behind.

</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> The comments suggest that the course CHEM 263 is largely about memorizing reactions and their reagents, with a focus on mechanisms and applications. The material itself is not considered bad, but the amount of practice required to understand the reactions can be time-consuming. The lab component is also mentioned as being more application-based and harder than the lab in CHEM 261. Some people suggest that it is worth taking the course to better understand the material for the MCAT, but it is not strictly necessary. The course is required to have a lab component, and it is a prerequisite for other courses. The depth and amount of information learned in the course is more than what is needed for the MCAT, but it can make studying for the exam easier. The course is considered more in-depth and not as broad as CHEM 261. The lab portion of the course is also mentioned as being helpful in understanding NMR. Overall, the course is considered to be challenging and time-consuming, but worth it for those who enjoy organic chemistry and want to gain a deeper understanding of the material.</ul>
