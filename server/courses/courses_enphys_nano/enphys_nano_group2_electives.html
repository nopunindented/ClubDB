<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> Based on the provided context, it appears that the commenter is sharing a link to a syllabus for a Mechanical Engineering course. While the specific course mentioned in the post is not ECE 450, it is possible to infer some information about the difficulty of ECE 450 based on the context.
         The fact that the commenter is sharing a syllabus for a Mechanical Engineering course suggests that they may be involved in or have some knowledge of engineering courses in general. Additionally, the use of the term "old syllabus" implies that the commenter may have some familiarity with the course content and structure of engineering courses.
         Based on this context, it can be inferred that ECE 450 is likely to be a challenging engineering course, given the general difficulty level of engineering courses and the fact that the commenter is sharing a syllabus for a related field. However, it is important to note that the specific difficulty of ECE 450 may vary depending on the instructor, teaching style, and individual student abilities.

<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> The comments suggest that ECE 485 may not require students to bring their lab kits, as the necessary equipment is provided in the lab room. However, students may still need to bring or acquire certain components for their projects during the capstone phase. The overall difficulty of the course is not explicitly stated in the comments, but it can be inferred that it involves lab work and potentially prototyping projects.</ul>
