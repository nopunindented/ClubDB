<h1>Group 2 Electives</h1>
<div class="course"><h2>CMPUT 250
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course Description:</strong><br>An interdisciplinary course for students in Science, Arts, and other faculties. The focus is on games as interactive entertainment, their role in society, and how they are made. Teams composed of students with diverse backgrounds (e.g. English, Art and Design, and Computing Science) follow the entire creative process: from concept, through pitch, to delivery, of a short narrative-based game using a commercial game engine. To achieve the required mix of backgrounds and experience, students must apply to be considered for this course. See the Department web site for the online form.<br></li>

</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> The course CMPUT 250 is known for having a significant workload, with students reporting spending a considerable amount of time on midterms, finals, labs, and a group project. The tests and labs are considered relatively easy, but the group project's success depends on the team's dynamics. The average grade for the course is reportedly high, around 3.9, indicating that those who put in the effort can expect good grades. Additionally, for students taking on the music role in the game development project, the time spent on creating music can vary greatly depending on the game's requirements and the availability of royalty-free sources. While some programming knowledge can be helpful for creating specialized sounds, it is not a requirement for this role as RPG maker is used for the course. Overall, CMPUT 250 is a challenging course that requires a substantial time commitment.</ul>

</li>
<li><strong>Course Difficulty:</strong><br> The course CMPUT 466 is considered to be quite challenging, with a heavy emphasis on calculus, statistics, and probability theory. Some students may find the programming portions to be difficult as well. However, there are alternative courses and resources available for those who may not have a strong math background or who prefer a more introductory approach to machine learning. The course is designed for beginners, but waivers for prerequisites may no longer be granted due to high demand. The final project is considered to be relatively easy and can be a fun way to apply machine learning methods to a dataset of interest. The exams are open-ended and require clear communication of ML concepts rather than memorization of formulas. It is recommended that students with a strong math background take the course, but alternatives are available for those who may struggle with the prerequisites.</ul>
